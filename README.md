live demo: https://a-rustacean.github.io/handwritten-digit-recognition-frontend/

> \[!Note]
> performs decently when training and running, but it takes a long time (~5 seconds) to load the mnist dataset. The entire training procedure will take about 4 hours on a computer with the specs:
> - 4 Core CPU
