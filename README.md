# handwritten-digit-recognition

A handwritten digit recognition machine learning model made in rust and trained with the mnist dataset

> Note: Very fast when training and running, but it takes a long time (1â€“2 seconds) to load the mnist dataset. The entire training procedure will take about 2 hours if your computer is like mine (4 core CPU, 8 gb ram).
