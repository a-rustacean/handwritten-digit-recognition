# handwritten-digit-recognition

A handwritten digit recognition machine learning model made in rust and trained with the mnist dataset

live demo: https://a-rustacean.github.io/handwritten-digit-recognition-frontend/

> Note: performs decent when training and running, but it takes a long time (2â€“4 seconds) to load the mnist dataset. The entire training procedure will take about 4 hours if your computer is like mine (4 core CPU, 8 gb ram).
